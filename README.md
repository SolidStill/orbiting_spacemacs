# orbiting_spacemacs
Replace contents of emacs.d/private/ with contents of this repo and symlink .spacemacs to expected path


## Crucially: 
###  .spacemacs file in this directory must be symlinked to same parent directory containing emacs.d (ie typically home folder) and named ".spacemacs" in order for backup configuration to be replicated.
